# Demagnetization tensor in macro scale

Demagnetization Energy is one of few energies being part of Effective Magnetic field in Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) which are used to create Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM). 

This project was developed to support scientists at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow with tool that allows them to calculate demagnetization tensor in 3D space between two different ferromagnetic objects. It is possible to use one of pre-defined objects or define own. Calculation of magnetisation tensor in macro scale is usually done on Supercomputers and requires a lot of computional power. This is PoC, designed in Python, project uses LUT to accelerate calculations. Using GUI requires one to have PyQt5 installed on device.
