# Magnetoresitance macro scale tensor calculation

This project was developed to support scientists at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow with tool that allows them to calculate magnetisation tensor in 3D space between two different objects. It is possible to use one of pre-defined objects or define own. Calculation of magnetisation tensor in macro scale is usually done on Supercomputers and requires a lot of computional power. This is PoC, designed in Python, project uses LUT to accelerate calculations. Using GUI requires one to have PyQt5 installed on device.
